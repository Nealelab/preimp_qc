### Todo
- [ ] Implement steps 4, 5, 7 QC filters
- [ ] Write function for generating Manhattan and QQ Plots (qqman doesn't order chromosome correctly)
- [ ] Add a Flags table
- [ ] Implement pre-QC sample/SNP filtering (something similar to [--keep/--remove samples] and [--extract/--exclude SNPS] in PLINK)
